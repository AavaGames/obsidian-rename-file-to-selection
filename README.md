# rename-file-to-selection
Rename your file to the current text selection.

## Commands
### Rename File to Selection
Uses the current selection / highlighted text in the active document to rename the active file after sanitizing it.

## Tips
- Add a hotkey to the command for ease of use, I use CRTL+ALT+R.
- Use the Commander community plugin to add a command button near your file title for ease of use on mobile.

## Install
Download main.js and manifest.json and add it to a folder called "rename-title-to-selection" in your vaults ".obsidian/plugins"

### Using BRAT obsidian plugin
1. Open BRAT and add to beta plugin
2. Paste in the github URL (https://github.com/AavaGames/obsidian-rename-file-to-selection/)
